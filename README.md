**Ember** is a lightweight and modular **2D game engine/framework** written in **C/C++**, designed to be simple yet
powerful. It aims to provide developers with a flexible **_cross-platform_** solution to build 2Ds and
applications.

## Building `WASM`

To build the Web version of the engine, you need to have [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) installed and activated.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsaint1/ember_engine.git
cd ember_engine

xmake f -p wasm
xmake build

python3 -m http.server -b 0.0.0.0 8080
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/build/webgl/`
